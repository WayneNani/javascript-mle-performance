# Performance Analysis JavaScript MLE in the Oracle Database

JavaScript modules can be installed within the Oracle Database since version 23ai. I have written a [blog post](https://seedandpublish.com/posts/javascript-mle-performance/) on how it compares to PL/SQL in terms of performance. This repository includes the scripts I used to perform the comparison. Feel free to rerun them on your hardware and suggest improvements.
